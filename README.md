In question 3, A0 was monitored. It was connected to VDD for the ADS1115 which was approximately 3.3V.
The ADS1115 was configured to use a voltage range from -4.096V to 4.096V. The reading at the A0 pin was
26533. The resolution of the ADS1115 would be 0.125 mV. Hence, the voltage reading at the pin is 26533 x 0.125mV = 3.317 V which
is roughly the same voltage level at A0 when measuring with a multimeter.
